# ðŸŽ¥ Real-Time Image Inversion on PYNQ-Z2 (1920x1080 @ 60 FPS)

This project demonstrates **real-time image processing** on the **PYNQ-Z2** board using **RTL design integrated into the PL (Programmable Logic)**. A custom **Image Inversion IP core** is developed and connected to the video pipeline to invert the colors of a live HDMI input stream at **1920x1080 resolution and 60 FPS**.

## ðŸ”§ Features
